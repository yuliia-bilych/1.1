          their banks, and even bring back to life species that have passed into
          oblivion. But it is not in our power to cleanse the air of stench, nor
          are we able to purify the oceans or save the earth from the wrath of the
          sun and the cosmos. <br>If we want to make a difference, we need to
          treat the cause of the disease, not the symptoms. People have to stop.
          No more poisoning the world with their existence! <br />However, we are
          not barbarians, we are not humans. Genocide is not our style. We will
          teach them to respect nature, and if they object, we are always ready to
          use force. <br>That is environmental protection nowadays.</span>
